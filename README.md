# Screener
This is a stock screener made using the yahoo finance api in python. It can be reformatted depending on criteria you might be looking for. 

## Improvements
The purpose of this screener was to make it easier to locate instances of intraday volatility in small caps, thus drastically reducing the time needed to collect data for specific setups given a specified set of criteria. This is really just a barebones screener, and it uses an outdated list of nasdaq stocks which in turn causes the program to take a long time to run. The end goal of this program is to filter through all (nasdaq) stocks meeting specific fundamental criteria, and spit out a csv so analysis can be done and a technical strategy can be developed. Hence moving forward, the largest improvement would be the introduction of a new, shorter list of stocks so data can be pulled over larger time frames in less time.
